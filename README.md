Dear Jonathan

Hello again. I'm Shiyu, your student from DSD last semester. How have you been?

So we are current working on the project of a panoramic video camera and wishing to take advantage of the high IO data rate as well as the parallel processing ability of FPGA. You have probably speak to another team of this project as well.

Would it be possible for you to take a bit of your precious time to give us some directions on the problem that we have encountered have so far?

About Interfacing: how should we collect data from cameras and input it to the FPGA? We researched about some 扒拉扒拉扒拉 daughter board but the cost of the board and the difficulty of development is a bit too much for us. So we are currently looking at a FPGA board that is specified for video signal processing and it has 4 way S-video input. It's using the architecture of Cyclone 4 + a ARM processor which is very similar to the DE1 SOC board that we are using. However, we are not too sure about how does the board decode these video signals. What kind of camera can we use to interact with the S-video input?

2. About HPS-FPGA bridge
Is it possible for us to decode signal from USB cameras using the HPS the transfer the data to FPGA using the HPS-FPGA bridge? This idea sounds pretty reasonable because there's usually usb host controller attached to HPS on soc boards. However, we haven't actually seen anyone has successfully done it yet. 

3. About signal decoding
加加加！！！
